# goals_hypothesis_test - Python
Hypothesis testing on number of goals scored in women's and men's football games since 2002 (World Cup only)
# This project was first completed on DataCamp (Hypothesis Testing with Men's and Women's Soccer Matches)
# the datasets are available to download on DataCamp.com
# the purpose of the project is to verify whether there is a statistically significant
# difference between goals scored in women's and men's games
# the test is run on a subset of the data, to include games from 2002 onward, and World Cup game only (no qualifiers)
# the original hypothesis was that women score more goals than men
# I changed this slightly and run two Mann-Whitney tests (instead of one), 
# the second test confirming that men do not score more than women
# (it would have been weird if they had contradicted each other)
